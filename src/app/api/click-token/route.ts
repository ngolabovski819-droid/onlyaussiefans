// Mints short-lived click-verification tokens (src/lib/clickToken.ts) for sponsored creators,
// called by client-side JS after a page has actually loaded (src/components/
// SponsoredLinkTokenizer.tsx) — never at render time, since this site's creator-listing
// pages/APIs use caching for performance.
//
// Always uncached (Cache-Control: no-store) — the whole point is that this reflects "someone's
// browser is looking at this page right now," not a value that can be fetched once and reused.
//
// What this actually proves, and what it doesn't: a plain HTTP client (curl/requests/aiohttp/
// Go/Java — every bot UA actually seen in this network's click logs) never executes page
// JavaScript at all, so it never calls this endpoint in the normal course of hitting /go/
// directly, which is the exact pattern behind every confirmed bot hit audited so far. A
// `Sec-Fetch-Site` header check was tried and dropped — tested directly and found unreliable on
// genuine browser requests AND trivially forgeable by any script willing to set it, so it added
// false confidence without real protection. This is a real, if modest, hurdle against the
// passive/naive scripts actually observed here, not a wall against someone who deliberately
// reverse-engineers and replicates this exact call.
